# Backpropagation Classification Using Keras

This project demonstrates **classification using a neural network trained with backpropagation**, implemented using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**.

The notebook focuses on translating core backpropagation concepts into a practical deep learning workflow using a high-level framework.

- Build and train neural networks efficiently
- Compare framework-based implementation with scratch implementation

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

## Project Purpose
This notebook is part of my **Deep Learning learning journey**, bridging the gap between **theoretical backpropagation (from scratch)** and **practical deep learning using frameworks**.
